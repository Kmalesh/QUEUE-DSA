Q.What is Vector ?

ANS:-  
A vector is a sequence container class that implements dynamic array, 
means size automatically changes when appending elements.
A vector stores the elements in contiguous memory locations and 
allocates the memory as needed at run time.

#...   Difference between vector and array  ....#

-----> An array follows static approach, means its size cannot be
 changed during run time while vector implements dynamic array means
  it automatically resizes itself when appending elements. <-----

# Syntax #

Consider a vector 'v1'. Syntax would be:

|----------------------- |
|vector<object_type> v1; | 
|------------------------|
